GenAI PDF QnA Chatbot
This is a Streamlit application that allows users to upload PDF files, convert them into text (including image-based PDFs using OCR), and ask questions about the content using an AI-powered QnA system. The application integrates with OpenAI's API for natural language processing and provides a simple, user-friendly interface for interaction.

Features
Upload PDF files (both text-based and image-based).
Extract text from PDFs using Poppler (for text PDFs) and Tesseract (for OCR).
Ask questions about the PDF content using OpenAI's GPT-based API.
Convert scanned image PDFs to searchable text.
Minimal token usage for API efficiency.
